## CLI Calculator
a simple cli calculator I made in less than 12 hours to get the hang of C++

#### Example of the program in action:
```
./clicalcuator --help
Welcome to my based sigma program.
Usage: ./clicalcuator [OPTION] num1 num2 num ...
      -m, --multiply  multiply 2 or more numbers together
      -a, --add  add 2 or more numbers together
      -s, --subtract  subtract 2 or more numbers against eachother
      -d, --divide  divide 2 or more numbers against eachother
      --help  print this screen
```
```
./clicalcuator -a 5 5
Welcome to my based sigma program.
Your inputs: 5 + 5
Your result is: 10
```
